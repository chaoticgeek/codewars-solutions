This is just a simple repo of some of the katas I have saved because I thought they were fun, interesting, or challenging. Below is a list of links and the title I gave them. Sorted into folders for the kyu they are assigned.

* 6kyu/alternating_split_encryption.py -- [Simple Encryption #1 - Alternating Split](https://www.codewars.com/kata/simple-encryption-number-1-alternating-split "My alternating split encryption kata") -- It was the first interesting one I saved. Simple text encryption problem that shifts every other character to the end of a string. First one I had to really think about. Could be improved and multi-line items are weird.
